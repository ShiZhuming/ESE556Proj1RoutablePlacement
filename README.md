To implement and experiment the Fiduccia-Mattheyses partitioning algorithm for gate-level designs. The goal of your partitioning project is to minimize the cutset size, while meeting given area constraints fixed for the partitions. Consider two area definitions in your implementations: 1) number of gates and 2) area of the gates.
